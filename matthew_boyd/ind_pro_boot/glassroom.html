Curated by Stephanie Hankey and Marek Tuszynski, the Glass Room was originally conceived and produced in the context of the exhibition “Nervous Systems” with support by Haus der Kulturen der Welt in the framework of “100 Years of Now” and is based on an original concept shown in March-May 2016 at the HKW in Berlin, Germany."

                    <h4><b>"NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--November 29, 2016 11:30 AM Eastern Standard Time</b></h4>
                    <br>
                    At first glance, The Glass Room looks like another slick tech store offering the latest shiny digital consumer products. Go inside, and you’ll find something more unusual on the tables - an <mark>“Unfit Bit”</mark> for fabricating exercise data, a facial recognition system to monitor event attendance, and the Sociometric badge for tracking employee workplace activity, such as who talks to whom, where and how often.
                    <br><br>
                    Launching on November 29, The Glass Room is actually a faux storefront where the <mark>‘products’ are artworks, investigations and activist projects designed to provoke personal reflection and public commentary on personal data, privacy and security.</mark> Some, like the <b>Sociometric badge</b> and the <b>Churchix facial-recognition attendance tracker</b>, are real products in the market today. The onsite volunteer store team is a helpful group of hoodie-wearing “inGeniouses”. Rather than upsell visitors on more memory or extra gadgets, the inGeniouses engage visitors in an examination of their online lives and offer strategies to better control personal data and privacy.
                    <br><br>
                    The Glass Room exhibition includes 54 objects and artworks spread across four tables:
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Open the Box</b> - a visualization and exploration of what 
                    our personal data looks like
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Something to Hide</b> -a look at how personal data is captured that forces us to consider whether we actually have nothing to hide
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Normal is Boring</b> - an exploration of ambitious and alarming moonshot projects U.S. tech giants are pursuing with their vast wealth
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Big Mama</b> - a look at tech innovations that normalize surveillance under the mandate of care
                    <br><br>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">"The Glass Room: A Real-World 'Black Mirror' Episode"</h2>

                     <h3 class="post-subtitle">"Steven Rosenbaum ,   CONTRIBUTOR - http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenrosenbaum/2016/12/05/the-glass-room-a-real-world-black-mirror-episode/#40562cb65a79 "</h3>
                    <br>
                     "Wandering the streets of New York, you encounter all kinds of unusual experiences. Stores that sell pointy shoes, shops of electronic wonders, storefronts filled with nothing other than tea and super-trendy fashion boutiques with clothes that seem impossibly revealing. You know, New York.
                     <br><br>

                    So, when you wander by 201 Mulberry Street, you can be excused if, at first glance, you think it’s just another shop of high-tech gizmos and glaringly white walls.
                    <br><br>
                    But enter the chamber known as The Glass Room – and you’ll be encountered with a disturbing array of well-told stories about data. <b>Admittedly, it’s probably not something you think about – your data.</b> Where it goes. Who sees it. What control you have over how it’s shared and used to target you.
                    <br><br>
                    But the pleasant and highly knowledgeable guides who offer to tour you through the exhibit and a remarkable way of suggesting, however gently, that there are ways to fight back over the subtle but growing totalitarian impact of data on our lives.
                    <br><br>
                    For example – our host explained – what happens if your company offers you a discount on your health insurance if you get health? Seems like a good idea – right? But <mark>what if those free FitBit devices double as trackers?</mark> What if employees who don’t walk a certain number of steps are penalized? When does positive support of health behavior become mandated, and digitally tracked, requirements?"

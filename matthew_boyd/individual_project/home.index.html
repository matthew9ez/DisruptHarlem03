					<h2>HOW TO SPOT A FAKE ACCOUNT</h2>
						<p>Account was made recently 2015, 2016.
						Account has no history published for earlier years, but Facebook says they have been a member since 2009, etc.
							<br><br>
							Most fake accounts have 1 image or no real profile photo of the person. Some may only have a select few photos over a long span of time. A well seasoned user would have more photos posted over a long period of time. A fake account may have 7-10 photos posted on the same day.
							<br><br>
							User has very few friends in common and or friends in general.
							<br><br>
							There is little to no interaction on their page with friends, no comments, likes or responses over their long time line.
							<br><br>
							Profile picture seems to good to be true, that hot model added you today! They even messaged you and are interested in you!
							<br><br>
							When in doubt use reverse image search. Take their image and see if it is a real person or not.
							<br><br>
							When in doubt deny, deny, deny.
